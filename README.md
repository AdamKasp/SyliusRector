## Learn Rector Faster

Rector is a tool that [we develop](https://getrector.org/) and share for free, so anyone can save hundreds of hours on refactoring. But not everyone has time to understand Rector and AST complexity. You have 2 ways to speed this process up:

* read a book - <a href="https://leanpub.com/rector-the-power-of-automated-refactoring">The Power of Automated Refactoring</a>
* hire our experienced team to <a href="https://getrector.org/contact">improve your code base</a>

Both ways support us to and improve Rector in sustainable way by learning from practical projects.
